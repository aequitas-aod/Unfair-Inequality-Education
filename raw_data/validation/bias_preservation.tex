\caption{Statistical tests results in comparing the distributions $P(h(X_\text{original})|S)$ and $P(h(X_\text{prep})|S)$ according to Sensitive Features $S$. The differences between the distributions (stat) are averaged among the possible target features (math, spanish, and english levels). The stat value, the lower the better, is colored red depending on how far it is from the critical value (critic).}
